# simple-js-app

This is a simple pokedex clone using vanilla Javascript version ES6, HTML5, and CSS3.

This app loads pokemon and their data from the pokemon api located here: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/

Getting this app running is as simple as visiting https://peluchemoreno.github.io/simple-js-app-poke/

Interacting with this app is simple.

- a list of pokemon, their names, and images will be automatically loaded onto your page.
- then when you click on a specific pokemon, you will be shown a larger image of the pokemon,
  along with data containing their height in 10ths of a meter, their type(s), and their basic moves.

This app is using ESLint and Prettier with their recommended settings applied.

Apart from that, **I hope you enjoy using my app** and it will continue to be updated periodically.
